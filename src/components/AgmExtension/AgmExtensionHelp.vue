      AGM Extension Help
    </h3>
    <div class="mt-6">
      <p class="ml-1">
        A company must have an annual general meeting (AGM) every calendar year, not more than 15
        months after the previous year's meeting. A company's first AGM must happen within 18 months
        of recognition. The date of an AGM becomes the company's annual reference date.
      </p>
      <p class="ml-1">
        Shareholders entitled to vote may decide by unanimous resolution to postpone the AGM to a
        later date than the annual reference date. They can also decide by unanimous resolution to
        waive the AGM for that year. A unanimous resolution to postpone or waive the AGM must pass on
        or before the annual reference date. Shareholders must select a new annual reference date.
      </p>
      <p class="ml-1">
        If a company does not pass a unanimous resolution before the required date, they must apply
        for an AGM extension.
